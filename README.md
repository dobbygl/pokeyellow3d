# pokeyellow

**Local Kanto 3D prototype:** 36 connected outdoor maps, Viridian Forest and
Vermilion Dock, with ROM-derived terrain, buildings and a bounded mesh cache.
Press **F3** for first-person view: **W** moves forward, **A/D** turn and **S**
turns around. All 179 reachable interiors load on demand, with real house,
healing, shopping, stairs, elevator and cave journeys verified. Unclassified
interior art keeps its original flat texture. Normal battles have an initial
3D arena with the original portraits and menus; party-change validation and
battle effects are still in progress in [PLAN_INTERIORES_COMBATES.md](PLAN_INTERIORES_COMBATES.md).
The default local build produces
`build/pokeyellow3d`. See [PALLET3D.md](PALLET3D.md) for scope, controls and tests.
Build with `-DPOKEYELLOW_3D=OFF` for the original `pokeyellow` executable below.

Static recompilation of Pokemon Yellow into portable C, built with
[GB-Recomp/gb-recompiled](https://github.com/GB-Recomp/gb-recompiled).

This repo ships pre-generated C sources so it builds out of the box —
you don't need an asm toolchain or the pret/pokeyellow decompilation just
to play.

## Build

You need a C/C++ compiler, CMake 3.16+, SDL2, libcurl, and OpenGL ES 2.
CMake fetches `gb-recompiled` automatically (no manual setup).

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . -j$(nproc)
```

This produces `pokeyellow3d` by default (`pokeyellow` with `-DPOKEYELLOW_3D=OFF`).

## Run

The runtime needs a ROM the first time it boots (it extracts assets into
`assets/pokeyellow/` and then runs from there on subsequent launches).

Drop a Pokemon Yellow ROM at `roms/pokeyellow.gbc` next to the executable:

```sh
mkdir -p roms
cp /path/to/pokeyellow.gb roms/pokeyellow.gbc
./pokeyellow3d
```

The launcher auto-starts when only one game is registered, so you go
straight into Red. Battery RAM saves to `pokeyellow.sav` next to the
binary. Press Esc in-game for the settings menu (palette, audio,
savestates, **Restart Game**, etc.).

## Regenerating the C sources

If you want to rebuild the C from scratch — bump `gb-recompiled`, pick
up a recompiler change, or tweak the analyzer — run:

```sh
tools/regen.sh /path/to/pret/pokeyellow /path/to/gb-recompiled
```

That re-builds the ROM via the pret toolchain (requires `rgbds`), then
invokes `gbrecomp` with the same flags the compilation uses, and copies
the freshly generated `pokeyellow_*.c` files into this repo. Verify with
`cmake --build .` and commit.

## In a compilation

If you're building a multi-cart compilation that wants to include Red,
add this repo via `FetchContent` in your top-level CMakeLists:

```cmake
FetchContent_Declare(pokeyellow
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/GB-Recomp/pokeyellow.git
    GIT_TAG main
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(pokeyellow)
# Now link the `pokeyellow_cart` target into your launcher executable
# and call pokeyellow_main(argc, argv) from your launcher's g_games[].
```

The standalone `pokeyellow` executable is only built when this repo is the
top-level project, so consuming it as a subdir doesn't produce a
conflicting executable target.
